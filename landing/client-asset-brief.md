Hi there,

We're building a dedicated laser hair removal landing page for Marr Laser & Skin Clinic. To get this right first time (and avoid back-and-forth), we need the following assets and information gathered upfront.

Anything marked **(REQUIRED)** is essential before we can start. Items marked **(NICE TO HAVE)** will strengthen the page but aren't blockers.

## 6. Photos & Media

The more real photography we have, the better the page converts. Stock photos hurt trust.

| Any video content — testimonials, clinic walkthrough, treatment demo | Nice to have | [ ] |

> **Photo tips**: Natural lighting, tidy space, landscape orientation where possible, minimum 1200px wide. Phone photos are fine if they're well-lit and in focus.
